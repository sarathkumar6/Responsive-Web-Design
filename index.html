                    No visit to the city is complete without a stroll down this famous and wonderful boulevard. Starting
                    at Plaça Catalunya and stretching down to the port, children and adults alike are treated to flower
                    sellers, animal stalls, painters, artists, human statues and street performers. A must for everyone.

                        The City Beaches
                    </span>
                    Perhaps an obvious one, but Barcelona has a fairly long stretch of coastline, and for city beaches,
                    they’re pretty darn good and certainly worth an excursion. The Olympic Village beaches are a little
                    more child-friendly, with a spider’s web climbing structure and a playground. Barceloneta is the old
                    fisherman’s quarters and has a great beach too.

                    This is a great spectacle and should be on everyone’s must-do list. Located at Plaça Espanya, the
                    nightly show features a water fountain that dances to lights and music. It’s much better later in
                    the summer, when it’s completely dark, and I’m aware that might be tough for readers with younger
                    kids, but I had to include it!

                    This park is a bit of a trek, but for older kids wanting a bit of fun, there is an amusement park at
                    the summit. Many of the attractions are very tame, but there’s a relatively new rollercoaster which

                    Right in the heart of the city, the site of the Dublin Castle has played a part in Ireland's history
                    since the land was used by Vikings to build a fortress in A.D. 930. Parts of the castle were built
                    and torn down through the ages, but the oldest remaining structure, the Record Tower, dates back to
                    the 13th century.

                    century. The beautiful and varied Italianesque garden is home to a large number of statues and
                    fountains. They were enlarged in the 17th century to their present extent and have come to form an
                    outdoor museum of garden sculpture that includes Roman antiquities as well as later works.

                    Florence’s supreme governing body for six centuries. Since 1872, it has served in part as a museum
                    and as the city town hall. This impressive palace packs a wealth of artifacts and art works that
                    include beautiful frescoes, sculptures, painted ceilings, intricate carvings and tapestries that all

                    greet you. The church is full of great art–worth a long look are Masaccio’s Trinity fresco across
                    from the entrance and the Tornabuoni chapel behind the altar, painted by Ghirlandaio’s workshop

                    incredible views of the caldera cliffs. There’s also a good SUP and snorkeling tour (but it doesn’t
                    go into the caldera).

                        Walk The Volcano
                    </span>
                    The island in the middle of the caldera is Nea Kameni and where you’ll find the island’s active
                    volcano and the top point of interest in Santorini. The crater is 130 meters up and takes about 20
                    minutes to walk to. Sulfur vents are found along the way. The only way to get here is by doing a
                    volcano boat tour or hiring a chartered boat.

                        Swim at Ammoudi Bay
                    </span>
                    One of the best swimming spots on Santorini is down the cliff from Oia at a spot just south of the
                    Ammoudi port. Walk or drive to Ammoudi Bay then take the path that leads south from the restaurants
                    in the port (can’t miss it, there’s only one way to go). It’s a 5 minute walk to a small island
                    (Agios Nikolaos) that you can swim out to. Then jump from the ledge (if you want).

                        Kamari Beach
                    </span>
                    Good swimming (though it’s a pebble-beach) and lots of restaurants. The pedestrian only street along
                    the beach is fun to walk at night when it gets quite busy. Jump from the boat into the cold water of
                    the caldera then swim towards the warm water of the volcanic hot springs. It never gets hot but it’s
                    warm enough to never feel the need to get out.

                    </span>
                    Belvedere Palace is really two splendid Baroque buildings: the Lower (Unteres) Belvedere and the
                    Upper (Oberes) Belvedere. Highlights of the Upper Palace include the Ground Floor Hall, with its
                    statues, and the Ceremonial Staircase, with its rich stucco relief and frescoes. Also worth seeing
                    is the Marble Hall, a stunning two-story hall with numerous period sculptures, paintings, and
                    ceiling frescoes.

                        Vienna Zoo
                    </span>
                    The origins of the Vienna Zoo (Tiergarten Schönbrunn) can be traced to Emperor Francis I's
                    menagerie, founded in 1752 and the oldest zoo in the world. With many of its original Baroque
                    buildings still intact, it's one of the most pleasant zoos in Europe to visit, particularly if you
                    spend a little time seeking refreshment in the original 18th-century Imperial Breakfast Pavilion
                    that now houses a great café.

                    Famous as Vienna's "nature and human-friendly" house, the decidedly odd (yet fascinating)
                    Hundertwasserhaus is well worth a visit. Designed by painter Friedensreich Hundertwasser, this
                    brightly colored landmark on the corner of Löwengasse and Kegelstrasse was completed in 1985 and its
                    main occupants - perhaps unsurprisingly - are artists, intellectuals, and creative types.

                        The Austrian Parliament Building
                    </span>
                    Standing as a witness to the great works of Theophil Hansen, the Austrian Parliament Building was
                    constructed between the time period of 1874 to 1883. Showcasing a perfect amalgamation of Greek and
                    Roman architecture, touring around this spectacular building will take you back to the ancient land
                    of Greece. It is a perfect place for the art and history buffs to be!
